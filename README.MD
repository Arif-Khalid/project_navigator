# Project Navigator
This is a casual project to help me navigate to my files easily through CLI.  
Are your cd keys worn out from overuse everytime you re-open a project?  
Worry no more! This project navigator can help you easily navigate to your repositories.  
The best use case is when working with multiple projects and you want to use CLI to navigate to those local repositories
